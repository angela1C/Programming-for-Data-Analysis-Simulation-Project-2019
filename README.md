## Problem statement
For this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing. You may pick any phenomenon you wish – you might pick one that is of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python. We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose.
Specifically, in this project you should:
- Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
- Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.
- Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
- Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.
Note that this project is about simulation – you must synthesise a data set. Some students may already have some real-world data sets in their own files. It is okay to base your synthesised data set on these should you wish (please reference it if you do), but the main task in this project is to create a synthesised data set. The next section gives an example project idea.

## Minimum Standard
The minimum standard for this project is a git repository containing a README, a gitignore file and a Jupyter notebook. The README need only contain an explanation of what is contained in the repository and how to run the Jupyter notebook. Your notebook should contain the main body of work and should list all references used in completing the project.
A good submission will be clearly organised and contain concise explanations of the particularities of the data set. The analysis contained within the notebook will be well conceived, interesting, and well researched. Note that part of this project is about the use of Jupyter notebooks and so you should make use of all the functionality available in the software including images, links, code and plots. You may use any Python libraries that you wish, whether they have been discussed in class or not.

## Marking Scheme

- 25% research: Investigation of the data set as demonstrated by references, background information, and ap- proach.
- 25% Development: Clear, well-written, and efficient code with ap- propriate comments.
- 25% Consistency: Good planning and pragmatic attitude to work as evidenced by commit history.
- 25% Documentation: Concise descriptions and plots of variables in the data set.
